Sean invented a game involving a 2nx2n matrix where each cell of the matrix contains an integer. He can reverse any of its rows or columns any number of times. The goal of the game is to maximize the sum of the elements in the  submatrix located in the upper-left quadrant of the matrix.

Given the initial configurations for nxn matrices, help Sean reverse the rows and columns of each matrix in the best possible way so that the sum of the elements in the matrix's upper-left quadrant is maximal.

Example

1 2
3 4
It is  and we want to maximize the top left quadrant, a  matrix. Reverse row :

1 2
4 3
And now reverse column :

4 2
1 3
The maximal sum is .

Function Description

flippingMatrix has the following parameters:
- int matrix[2n][2n]: a 2-dimensional array of integers

Returns
- int: the maximum sum possible.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the number of queries.

The next  sets of lines are in the following format:

The first line of each query contains an integer, .
Each of the next  lines contains  space-separated integers  in row  of the matrix.

Explanation

Start out with the following  matrix:

Perform the following operations to maximize the sum of the  submatrix in the upper-left quadrant:

Reverse column  (), resulting in the matrix:
Reverse row  (), resulting in the matrix:
The sum of values in the  submatrix in the upper-left quadrant is .
